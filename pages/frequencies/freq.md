## Radio Frequencies

Some radio walkie-talkie has a proprietary "codes" of the channels they are connected on.

Essentially, these are not any special codes, but just an ordering
numbers 0~99 where each number corresponds to a specific
frequency. The problem is that these proprietary radios do not provide
any alternative way to directly specify certain frequency, leading
often to a situation that no one knows what exact frequency is on the
specific "code number" on the radio.

Walkie-talkie from e.g. Baofeng, where there are no such "codes" by
default, but all these frequencies are set directly, often needed to
be programmed ahead with
[CHIRP](http://chirp.danplanet.com/projects/chirp/wiki/Home). So a
user of Baofeng radio can further set, say `446.00625` to a code
`120`, which would correspond to a code `P1` on Midland G7, for
example. However, if CHIRP wasn't used or the radio was not prior
programmed, here is a helper mappings what frequencies are behind
those "codes".

Usage is simple. Someone with e.g. G7 Midland can say "I am on P1", so
you can look it up and find out that he is actually on `446.00625`
frequency.

As simple as that!
