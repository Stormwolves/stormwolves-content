The "Dark Emergency 4" event was in total a four day adventure for everyone, who loves to wear camo uniform fire bullets. There was a sort of role playing, although not as strict as initially thought.

As a separate posting, you can find a photo gallery about this event.

## Where

Location of the event was chosen in a wonderful place near Magdeburg at an old Soviet military base. Right now it serves a place where tank drivers are trained. Geographically it is equally reachable from the entire Germany corners as well as the nature was great to be there.

What we would wish for? A different time, a bit towards the Summer. Making this during the crazy April doesn't cut very well: too cold for fun, unless you are a bad ass commando and love to sleep in a negative temperatures. Well, at least it wasn't raining... too much...

## How

From the organization point it was amazing. Boarding, showers, toilets, place, camping area, security, gaming place, food and beverage, shops... everything! Kudos to the organization team. It was really great, thank you a lot. Especially great was shower cabins: clean, nice and effective. Warm shower after an exhausting time is a great idea! If the weather would be a little bit warmer evenings, would be just perfect.

However, there is also a bad part of organization: the website and online resource was literally that bad. Not to mention that the online published rules were very different from the actual rules. As an example, online rules were banning all full-auto (0.5J) weapons, while in reality it was not true! What a shame, that could be a game changer. Another problem was with the beverage: online rules was forbidding bringing with yourself your bought beer, while in reality it was only forbidden to bring it to the public place in front of the scene. But you still could enjoy best Bavarian beer near your tents. Our wishes that the next time this be addressed properly. I am sure, organizers can handle that great.

## What

Stormwolves team was a part of KGG, or "The Bad Guys". The official results of the game are pretty clear: KGG lost. But did they?

Consider that the flow of the game wasn't close or nearly close to the reality. Instead it was more like an Unreal Tournament (or Quake or Doom) shooter computer game: respawn is unlimited and very cheap. Therefore, when "The Good Guys" or GOF were losing (and they were), then they were starting just "throwing a meat" at KGG. This tactics is basically no tactics at all, but simpy kill at least one and die. Since GOF was as twice as bigger, this "tactics" works just fine. And, of course, if that would be a ten times bigger space for playing, this way would not be very helpful, since you would be required to walk to the respawn place quite a distance in kilometers! But since the field was relatively compact, it is no problem to walk another five hundred meters and do the same all over again.

First, KGG was significantly smaller then "The Good Guys". The Good Guys were also collaborating with the militia, or "civilians". Civilians, in a theory, supposed to periodically fight for both sides, depends on bribing efficiency. However, in reality, they were mostly fighting on the side of "The Good Guys" and used time of being enemy of good only in order to come closer to "The Bad Guys" and then start shooting at them. So it wasn't very much helping for them to get Darth Vader's cookies as a reward.

But, to be fair, militia sometimes supported KGG. Like this:

GOFs were also cheating a lot, having [Duncan MacLeod's immortality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duncan_MacLeod). Especially, when KGG was kicking their butt like hell. We, ourselves, caught few times a fact when "yellows" that we've shot in the back multiple hits and saw how BBs are bouncing from them, yet they were continue playing, running away. This is not cool. This time GOF's General met KGG's knife, but the next time we will kill your General [with a Tea Cup](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16RdEtQL9EQ). :-)

## Wishes

The following wishes for the Dark Emergency 5:

* Hey! Don't be a pussy (cat). Allow max 2J for the semi-auto! At least we can get ya from behind the leaves if you are sitting more than 50 meters away.

* Do not ban any full-auto 0.5J weapons. Full-auto is really fun and is a good performant even in the wood land.

* But allow only low-cap mags on 0.5J! That will stop cowboys from bringing "snow" to the ground.

* Make it a bit later, closer to the Summer. So it won't be dog-cold overnite and in case of rain, won't be a catastrophy.


We had a lot of fun! You should join next time, if you haven't.
