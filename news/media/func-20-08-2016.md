There was a great game at Radiostation, or so-called "Funkstation".

We had pretty funny accidents, whole three times. There some locals used their car for racing around the field and made those who lives there. Well, police *came to us* for this. Whole three times. We enjoyed talking to them, showing them our weapons, joking about life and supporting their complaints that they should do their job in a wrong way.

Airsoft guys don't do wrong. There is no politics, no hate, no wrong doing. Airsoft is just a sport that looks military. Police knows that, but they _have_ to do their job, follow protocol, make papers etc.

P.S. My table is always busy with some foreign "crap" on it, as long as I open it.
